# devicecode-data

This repository contains pre-generated data files for use with
[DeviceCode](https://github.com/armijnhemel/devicecode) so you don't have to
generate them.

The data comes from various sources. Depending on the source there could be a
different license.

## Device information

* TechInfoDepot: this data is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
  except files in the `overlays/` directory which are licensed under different
  licenses: FCC id files are licensed under [CC0][CC0], network OUI files are
  under the same license as Wireshark (GPL-2.0)
* FCC: files in this directory describe metadata of PDF files with FCC
  registration information, such as SHA256 checksums of PDFs, images extracted
  from PDFs, as well as references to possibly interesting extracted text. As
  the files describe metadata they are licensed under [CC0][CC0].

Inside each directory there will be two or three subdirectories:

* `original`: the original data, useful for debugging. In the case of
  TechInfoDepot and WikiDevi this will be an XML snippet.
* `devices`: JSON output as generated by DeviceCode
* `overlays`: JSON overlay files (see DeviceCode for an explanation)
