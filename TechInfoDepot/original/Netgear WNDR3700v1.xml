:[https://forum.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Netgear_WNDR3700 Install Guide]

The Netgear WNDR3700 is an extremely powerful consumer 802.11 a/b/g/n router, sporting a lightning fast Atheros CPU, lots of RAM, lots of flash space, and capable of high transmit power that even gives 2Wire a run for the money makes this router is ready for the future, and DD-WRT makes it even better. Installation of DD-WRT is very simple and can be done in a few steps.

'''1.''' Download DD-WRT for the WNDR3700 from here: ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/08-12-10-r14929/netgear-wndr3700/wndr3700-factory.img

'''2.''' Make sure you are connected to the router with an ethernet cable. Then upgrade your firmware through the stock firmware web interface, the process will take a few minutes. &lt;font color=red&gt;Do not interrupt the upgrade process and '''wait at least 2 minutes after 100% is reached.''' &lt;/font&gt;

'''3.''' The wireless LEDs should now be flashing, and if your NIC card is gigabit, you should also see one orange LAN led, if you see these your flash is complete and you can now proceed to the 30/30/30 or triple 30 reset.

'''4.''' Hold the reset button under the router for 30 seconds and do not release it, while still holding the reset button &lt;font color=red&gt;'''unplug'''&lt;/font&gt; the router and leave it unplugged for 30 more seconds. Still holding the reset button, plug the router back in and wait yet another 30 seconds. Unplug the router again and release the reset button, plug it back in and &lt;font color=red&gt;'''wait at least 2 minutes'''&lt;/font&gt;, this is critical as the router is building NVRAM settings.

'''5.''' Repeat step 4 one final time.

'''6.''' Power cycle the router, unplug it for 30 seconds and plug it back in, or use the switch. Installation is now complete.

Now that DD-WRT is fully installed and NVRAM is cleared, ensure your PC does not have any internal '''static''' IP then point your browser to 192.168.1.1, this is the DD-WRT default IP and can be changed to any IP you like. You should be at the username and password screen, set them accordingly then proceed to setting up your new DD-WRT WNDR3700.

==Upgrading==
To upgrade to a newer build of DD-WRT, use the web interface and selecting the &quot;wndr3700-webflash.bin&quot; file instead. &lt;font color=red&gt;Do not select &quot;restore defaults&quot;&lt;/font&gt; or you may have a [http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=76805 semi bricked device]. There has been many reports of that setting bricking multiple different routers yet some have no issue, so &lt;font color=red&gt;USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!&lt;/font&gt; You should not have to restore to defaults just from upgrading builds, to restore to defaults instead use the far superior [http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Hard_reset_or_30/30/30 triple 30 reset]. Also, if you do partially brick your router, use [http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/TFTP_flash#Special_for_Vista.2C_Win7_and_Win_2008 this page] to unbrick it.

==Reverting==
So you've bought a shiny new wireless router for your home network and loaded it with DD-WRT. Like myself, you've decided it's just not for you and you'd rather return to the factory firmware. I've read through the forums and still found the guides a little confusing. So here's how to restore the stock or factory firmware on your Netgear WNDR3700 router in five simple and easy to understand steps.

Before you begin you will need to gather these resources:

::1. A push pin, safety pin or needle.
::2. A copy of the latest WNDR3700 firmware which you can download [http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14244 [HERE]]


&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''** NOTE:'''&lt;/big&gt; that this guide was written for the Netgear WNDR3700-100NAS Revision: 02R1 using Windows 7 64-bit. This will work for any WNDR3700 router currently running DD-WRT.&lt;/font&gt;

====Step 1: Setting Your Static IP Address====
It is important that you setup a static IP address on your computer. Navigate to: ''&quot;'''Start'''&quot;'' -&gt; ''&quot;'''Control Panel'''&quot;'' -&gt; ''&quot;'''Network and Internet'''&quot;'' -&gt; ''&quot;'''Network and Sharing Center'''&quot;'' -&gt; ''&quot;'''Change adapter settings'''&quot;'' (left side). Now right click on your local area connection and open up the properties window. Select ''&quot;'''Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)'''&quot;'' and click on properties. Enter the following information then click &quot;OK&quot;.

 IP address: 192.168.1.2
 Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
 Default gateway: &lt;leave blank&gt;
 Preferred DNS server: &lt;leave blank&gt;
 Alternate DNS server: &lt;leave blank&gt;

====Step 2: Placing the Router Into Recovery Mode====
Start by turning off the router using the power button on the back of the device. Now, using the small object of your choice, press and hold the &quot;Restore Factory Settings&quot;, also known as the Reset button located on the bottom of the router (there is a red ring around it). While holding the rest button, turn the router back on. Continue to hold the reset button for approximately 45 seconds then release it.

&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''** NOTE:'''&lt;/big&gt; Before you release the reset button, just be sure the power LED light on the router is flashing. If it isn't, continue to hold it for about another 15 seconds until it is flashing.&lt;/font&gt;

====Step 3: Enable the TFTP Client in Windows====
If you are using Windows Vista or Windows 7, you will need to enable the TFTP client. To do this, navigate to: ''&quot;'''Start'''&quot;'' -&gt; ''&quot;'''Control Panel'''&quot;'' -&gt; ''&quot;'''Programs'''&quot;'' -&gt; ''&quot;'''Programs and Features'''&quot;'' -&gt; ''&quot;'''Turn Windows features on or off'''&quot;'' (left side). From there, scroll down until you spot ''&quot;'''TFTP Client'''&quot;''. Check the box if it isnt already and click &quot;OK&quot;. Exit the control panel.

====Step 4: Flash the Firmware====
Start by opening up a command prompt. From there you will want to type &quot;cd desktop&quot; in order to change your working directory to your desktop. Assuming of course that is where you saved the firmware download. Now for the fun bit. In the command window type:

 tftp -i 192.168.1.1 put WNDR3700-V1.0.4.68NA.img

&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''** NOTE:'''&lt;/big&gt; Be sure to use the appropriate name of the file you are trying to flash. It may be a later version then the one I used as an example.&lt;/font&gt;

====Step 5: The Waiting Game====
This would be the perfect time to go grab a drink or hit the washroom. You need to be patient. Do not turn off, restart, unplug cables or otherwise interact with your router. It may take a little while; this is normal! Watch the power LED light on the front of the router. It should remain orange throughout the process. Once it is complete, it will turn green. At this point you may proceed to point your browser to &quot;192.168.1.1&quot; and continue to setup your router.

Good luck!

==Notes==
===Known Issues===
Since DD-WRT is still in beta there is some issues with the WNDR3700, having followed the proper safe procedure above, you should have minimal or no issues. If luck is not on your side then take a look at the current known most critical issues and fixes for them if there is any.

====Issue 1====
There has been some reports of very weak ath0/ath1 (both radios 2.4GHz and 5GHz) after flashing DD-WRT, but there is also reports of weak wireless with those that never flashed DD-WRT. The issue is still under investigation but it is probably faulty hardware related, one can only speculate the cause but it could be TX power related. Owners with this problem report the wireless is so weak one can't move any further away from the router than 1 meter. A [http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AjNDNODfzgytdEJvZ0N0SkFLejFJZzBHcnFaaUg4OGc&amp;hl=en&amp;output=html chart has been made] by a WNDR3700 owner that is linked at the bottom of this page, you have over 85% chance to get a good working router.

'''Fix:''' None short of exchanging the router for another one.

====Issue 2====
Some report MAC addresses changing to FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, this can be caused by a improper flash. Reflash following the steps above before attempting the fix. If reflashing did not fix the problem replacing caldata should, see fix link.

====FAQ====
'''Q: After flashing DD-WRT, the LAN LEDs are now green for 10/100M and orange 1000M?'''

''A: This is an intentional change by the DD-WRT developers, Netgear had the colors backwards as gigabit is usually orange (check your NIC card!).''
----
'''Q: I heard some WNDR3700 radios were dying shortly after flashing DD-WRT? Does the firmware damage routers?'''

''A: No DD-WRT does not damage routers, there is also reports as said above, of WNDR3700's having weak wireless even when DD-WRT was never put on it. It is most likely a faulty hardware issue.''
----
'''Q: Is there going to be a special version after DD-WRT is out of beta for this router?'''

''A: Maybe, maybe not. Probably not because Netgear already paid for special support *for us*, this is why WNDR3700 has extra features such as RP-PPPOE server and per user/subnet/MAC QoS speed control as these are special build features.''
----
'''Q: My wireless performance dropped after installing DD-WRT?'''

''A: Refer to the [http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Atheros/ath_wireless_settings Atheros wireless settings wiki page], you are probably using defaults or incorrect settings.''
----
'''Q: What is the default username and password for DD-WRT?'''

''A: Username is &quot;root&quot; and password is &quot;admin&quot;.''
----
'''Q: Are my wireless LEDs supposed to be flashing constantly? Stock firmware didn't do this.'''

''A: Yes they are, that is another intentional change to DD-WRT. The slow steady flashing means the radios are on with no activity, when there is data being transferred they will rapidly flash like stock firmware.''

----

'''Q: With stock firmware I was able to setup a guest AP or virtual AP, can I do this as well with DD-WRT?'''

''A: Absolutely, and much much more!''
