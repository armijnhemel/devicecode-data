==Overview==
&quot;3763-01010105R&quot; is silkscreened on the board of some / all production model units.&lt;br /&gt;
E1000 v1 serial numbers appear to start with '''CVN0'''.

The default SSID is '''CiscoXXXXX''' where '''XXXXX''' is the last 5 digits of the serial number. If the device has been configured with Cisco Connect the device will probably have a [[Cisco Connect SSIDs|randomly generated SSID]]. A sample serial number is CVN01K6E1346.

===Flashing dd-wrt===
{{DDWRTNotice|microno}}
{{DDWRTNotice|k26req}}
'''WARNING:''' This is only for version 1 hardware.  &lt;font color=darkred&gt;For version 2:&lt;/font&gt; [[Linksys E1000 v2.0]]

Supported by dd-wrt as of = dd-wrt.v24-15279_NEWD-2_K2.6

Exactly the same hardware as [[Cisco Valet M10 v1|M10]] and [[Linksys WRT160N v3|WRT160N v3.0]]

====Install Procedure====
# Read the [http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=51486 Peacock Announcement].
# Download a trailed mini build (named ''mini_e1000v1.bin'') from the broadcom_K26 folder.
#* Old builds are named ''mini_e1000.bin'', before the v2 hardware was supported
#*If you wish to experiment with a newer build, read it's build thread before flashing!
# Set a static IP on your computer e.g. 192.168.1.7 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0
# Connect an ethernet cable from your computer to a router LAN port.  Do NOT use wireless!
#*Recommended to disconnect other cables.
# Perform a [[#Performing a Hard Reset|hard]] reset.
# Navigate to &lt;nowiki&gt;http://192.168.1.1/&lt;/nowiki&gt; for the Linksys web GUI
# Go to the Linksys ''Administration-&gt;Firmware Upgrade'' page.  Do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; give the reboot command. You will use this page to upgrade your firmware.
# Browse to the downloaded firmware and click Upload.
# Do not touch anything. The page will tell you that the upgrade was successful and the router is now rebooting. Your router may take upwards of a couple minutes to reboot. Watch the lights... once the wireless and power indicators are on steadily for several seconds, your router is fully rebooted and you can click &quot;Continue&quot; in your browser window.
# If the DD-WRT password change page displays, your upgrade has been successful, and you must now perform another hard reset. This time, when you navigate to &lt;nowiki&gt;http://192.168.1.1/&lt;/nowiki&gt;, click &quot;Reboot&quot; and wait for the router to come online again so you can configure it.
*Make sure all builds you flash are less than 8 000 000 bytes in size or you will brick the router.

If the DD-WRT password change page does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; display, your page request times out, or you can't ping 192.168.1.1, make sure both wireless and power lights are on steadily first, then do a hard power cycle (unplug the power from the router—do not do a 30/30/30 reset). Wait a few seconds and plug the power back into the router. Wait until both wireless and power lights are on steadily, then navigate to &lt;nowiki&gt;http://192.168.1.1/&lt;/nowiki&gt; in your browser of choice again. If the DD-WRT password change page displays, your upgrade has been successful, and you must now perform another [[#Performing a 30/30/30 Reset on a Linksys E1000 v1.0|hard 30/30/30]]. This time, when you navigate to 192.168.1.1, click &quot;Reboot&quot; and wait for the router to come online again so you can configure it.

You can also flash the same firmware of TomatoUSB as described for [http://infodepot.wikia.com/wiki/Linksys_WRT160N_v3.0 WRT160N_v3.0]

Firmware version 33555 dated 10/20/17 runs on this router, but doesn't have the final Broadcom fix for the KRACK vulnerability in WPA2. KRACK fixes for Broadcom were completed in ​SVN 33678, but build 33679 is missing many files, so it is recommended to use 33772 or newer, '''after''' reviewing New Build threads.

See [[TechInfoDepot:DD-WRT/Firmware FAQ#Where do I download firmware.3F|Where do I download firmware?]] for build links.

====Performing a Hard Reset====
Procedure for an E1000v1:
#Perform a [[TechInfoDepot:DD-WRT/Hard reset or 30/30/30|normal 30/30/30 reset]].
#Login to &lt;nowiki&gt;http://192.168.1.1/&lt;/nowiki&gt; and you will see the Linksys - Management Mode page.
#Click &quot;Reboot&quot; then after a moment, you will see &quot;Command reboot completed.&quot; and reboot again.
#When the lights return to their normal state, click &quot;Continue&quot; to the router GUI main page.

===Flashing Tomato===
=====Preparation=====
# Use a wired connection only. (disable wireless to be in the safe side)
# Make sure you disable firewall in Windows.
# Disable the virus guard.

=====Let's Begin!=====
# Download and extract the K26-MIPSR2 Tomato USB Firmware. Mini, STD or VPN version is up to you. With this router you can only use certain builds. It's flash size is only 4MB. (Get them [http://tomatousb.org/download Here])
# Connect your computer's using network cable to one of the LAN ports of the Asus router. Manually set your computer IP address (in the TCP/IP properties of the LAN connection) to 192.168.1.2, network mask 255.255.255.0.
# Upgrade to [[#dd-wrt|dd-wrt]] first.
# After upgrade, go to the router by typing 192.168.1.1, after setting the username and password go to administration then firmware upgrade. Click browse and find the TomatoUSB firmware file. Click upgrade.
# After upgrading is complete open your browser, go to the router by typing 192.168.1.1, when prompted for a username and password enter &quot;root&quot; and &quot;admin&quot;. Go to Administration &gt; Configuration &gt; Restore Default Configuration, select &quot;Erase all data in NVRAM memory (thorough)&quot; and click OK. To insure that the processor has time to complete addressing all NVRAM variables it's best to wait about 5 minutes before making any changes.

You are now ready to start using your Asus router with Tomato.

====JTAG Recovery====
[http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=146077 Source]

As most know.. The wrt160n v3 &amp; the E1000 v1 are identical in regards to hardware.

As most know, Linksys has disabled the jtag circuit in these routers by leaving out smt components (just like the 610 v2 &amp; E3000)

I'll link this in another thread where a dd-wrt member needs jtag for this router.

I traced the jtag header to the missing components. What needs to be done, is to bridge the pads on the pcb. There are 5 pads that need to be bridged.

Four can be found on the bottom of the pcb, and one on the top.

They are marked R64, R65, R66, R67, &amp; R68.

R67 is on the top side of the pcb, and the rest on the bottom.

Attached are pics showing the pads that need to be bridged as well as the jtag output doing a -probeonly.

The ribbon cable you will see in one of the pics, is connected to a serial header I hot glued to the side of the pcb. This router I purchased to assist the devs (Eko) in porting dd-wrt to this router. Cuz we bricked it many times, pogo pins to the serial pads would not do. I needed something I could connect to many times.

====Serial Pinouts====
 VCC  o TP12
  TX  o TP13
  RX  o TP14
 N/C  o TP15
 GND  o TP16

====Serial Recovery====
First familiarize yourself with [[TechInfoDepot:DD-WRT/Serial Recovery|Serial Recovery]] and reference the [[TechInfoDepot:DD-WRT/Serial port pinouts#Linksys E1000v2 E2000|serial pinout (E1000v2)]].

Once at the prompt '''you need to assign an IP/Subnet mask to eth0'''. I'm not sure if eth0 is the routers interface to the switch or one specific port but I had a '''CAT5 cable hooked up to port 1 on the router''' and it worked.

If you type &quot;ifconfig eth0&quot; you will see that there is no address assigned to the interface. The following command will assign an address/mask.

CFE&gt; '''ifconfig eth0 addr=192.168.1.1 mask=255.255.255.0'''

Now you can flash using a TFTP client from your computer, which is plugged in to port 1 on the router, just like the [[TechInfoDepot:DD-WRT/Serial Recovery|Serial Recovery]] page says.

'''flash -ctheader : flash1.trx'''
