      <text bytes="4061" sha1="0yycu0vbmjrsxjcyuvrx60qzjujrghw" xml:space="preserve">A '''network switch''' (also called '''switching hub''', '''bridging hub''', and, by the [[IEEE]], '''MAC bridge'''&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.1D&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[Wikipedia:networking hardware|networking hardware]] that connects devices on a [[Wikipedia:computer network|computer network]] by using [[Wikipedia:packet switching|packet switching]] to receive and forward data to the destination device.

A network switch is a multiport [[Wikipedia:network bridge|network bridge]] that uses [[Wikipedia:MAC address|MAC address]]es to forward data at the [[Wikipedia:data link layer|data link layer]] (layer 2) of the [[Wikipedia:OSI model|OSI model]]. Some switches can also forward data at the [[Wikipedia:network layer|network layer]] (layer 3) by additionally incorporating [[Wikipedia:routing|routing]] functionality. Such switches are commonly known as layer-3 switches or [[Wikipedia:multilayer switch|multilayer switch]]es.&lt;ref name=layer3&gt;{{cite web|author=Thayumanavan Sridhar |url=http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_1-2/switch_evolution.html |title=Layer 2 and Layer 3 Switch Evolution |series=The Internet Protocol Journal |volume=1 |issue=2 |publisher=Cisco Systems |website=cisco.com |date=September 1998 |access-date=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switches for [[Wikipedia:Ethernet|Ethernet]] are the most common form of network switch. The first MAC Bridge&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Robert|last2=Hawe|first2=William|last3=Kirby|first3=Alan|date=April 1984|title=Local Area Network Connection|journal=Telecommunications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Hawe, A. Kirby, A. Lauck, &quot;An Architecture for Transparently Interconnecting IEEE 802 Local Area Networks&quot;, technical paper submitted to the IEEE 802 committee, document IEEE-802.85*1.96, San Diego CA, October 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hawe|first=William|title=Advances in Local Area Networks|last2=Kirby|first2=Alan|last3=Stewart|first3=Robert|publisher=IEEE Press|year=1987|isbn=0-87942-217-3|pages=Chapter 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; was invented&lt;ref&gt;United States Patent 4,597,078&lt;/ref&gt; in 1983 by Mark Kempf, an engineer in the Networking Advanced Development group of [[Wikipedia:Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital Equipment Corporation]]. The first 2 port Bridge product (LANBridge 100) was introduced by that company shortly after.  The company subsequently produced multi-port switches for both Ethernet and [[Wikipedia:Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI]] such as GigaSwitch.  Digital decided to license its MAC Bridge patent in a royalty-free, non-discriminatory basis that allowed IEEE standardization.  This permitted a number of other companies to produce multi-port switches, including [[Wikipedia:Kalpana (company)|Kalpana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 10 Most Important Products of the Decade |author=Robert J. Kohlhepp |date=2000-10-02 |access-date=2008-02-25 |publisher=Network Computing |url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/1119/1119f1products_5.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105152318/http://www.networkcomputing.com/1119/1119f1products_5.html |archive-date=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethernet was initially a [[Wikipedia:Shared medium|shared-access medium]], but the introduction of the MAC bridge began its transformation into its most-common point-to-point form without a [[Wikipedia:collision domain|collision domain]].  Switches also exist for other types of networks including [[Wikipedia:Fibre Channel|Fibre Channel]], [[Wikipedia:Asynchronous Transfer Mode|Asynchronous Transfer Mode]], and [[Wikipedia:InfiniBand|InfiniBand]].
