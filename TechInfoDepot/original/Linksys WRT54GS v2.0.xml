''[comment added 3/23/08 by Bugman916]''
Just installed dd-wrt on my WRT54GS v2.0 router. I started with RC 6.2 dd-wrt.v24_mini_wrt54gs through the Linksys interface. Then I used the new dd-wrt mini interface to install RC6.2 dd-wrt.v24_std_generic. Everything seems &quot;ok&quot;, I had no problems getting firmware installed. 
'''reminder''' Default login/pw .. root/admin

I had no trouble installing dd-wrt.v24_std_generic.bin onto my v2 WRT54GS. I didn't need to install mini first, didn't need to play with FTP, just installed it via the firmware update page. It worked without using the reset button.&lt;br /&gt;[[User:Jax184|Jax184]] 07:42, 15 June 2008 (CEST)

''[comment added 7/18/08 by koolkat]''
Does NOT need VxWorks killer to install due to the fact that factory firmware is linux based.
Installed VINTage Mega firmware after installing VINTage standard, had no problems at all.

&quot;[comment added 10/05/08 by mikeandmonika]&quot;
Installed DD-WRT v24-sp1 (07/26/08) mega-special (upgraded from HyperWRT through GUI). Upgrade took approximately 20 minutes to complete, but all is well and working great.

''[comment added 12/20/08 by Corehop]''
Successfully installed dd-wrt.v24-9517_VINT_std.bin from factory linksys web GUI. Then tried upgrading to dd-wrt.v24-9517_VINT_mega.bin using the DDWRT web GUI, but when the router reset, it would not respond to pings and I had to short pins 15 and 16 on the flash chip and TFTP the Linksys firmware.

Comment [[User:galengish|galengish]] at 10:34 (EST) on 06 Jan 2009: I flashed a Linksys WRT54GS v2 router last night from original firmware to DD_WRT v24 (05/20/2008) std in one shot. This was performed via Internet Explorer and the Web GUI via Ethernet cable. The flash was successful on the first try and it is now successfully working as a client-bridge with another WRT54GS v7 running original Linksys firmware.

Comment [[User:Milkman|Milkman]] at 8:47 (CST) on 26 Mar 2009: I just installed v24-sp1 mega from the Linksys firmware and it seems to have installed without a hitch, although I haven't had a chance to play around much yet. It is indicating &quot;Error&quot; on the title bar in my browser, but this may be associated with the lack of WAN connectivity for the router at this point. Will update should I find any significant errors/problems. (I hope I get the formatting correct here, please bear with me as I am new to wiki submissions)

Updated 10 Apr 2009: OK, backing up to v24 doesn't cause the &quot;error&quot; reporting on the browser (like in [http://docprof.it.sitronics.com/ Электронный документооборот], seems to be something with the SP1 release. Haven't checked change logs, but seems very happy with v24 mega.

''[comment added 3/22/2010 by geohey]''
I followed the flash instructions for WRT54GS v1.0 with no problems at all.
