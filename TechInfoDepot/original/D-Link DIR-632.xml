'''8 ETHERNET PORTS FOR UNLIMITED CONNECTIVITY TO ALL YOUR DEVICES'''

Delivering great wireless performance, network security and coverage, the D-Link Wireless N 8-Port Router (DIR-632) is ideal for building a powerful network. Designed to do the heavy-lifting and get your small business humming, 8 ports let you connect just about anything you can imagine, all at once - printers, laptops, desktops, security cameras, servers, storage drives - you name it, the DIR 632 can handle it. It also serves as an excellent home router, since it's ideal for providing wired Internet connectivity for video, music, photos, and documents.

==Flashing==
{{Flashnotice}}
===Flashing dd-wrt===
dir632a build 17967 20111207

'''''Please note that is is pre-release firmware at the momment.  Please read the support forum listed at the bottom of this page before loading it on you router to avoid bricking it.'''''
===Out-of-the-box factory firmware upgrade===
To install dd-wrt on a stock D-Link DIR-632, you can flash it directly from the router's web admin page (yes, that is correct... from D-Link's standard web interface). These are the steps to follow: 
#Download the current firmware: 
##NA (North America) - [ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2013/01-24-2013-r20548/dlink-dir632a/ Factory-to-ddwrt ] r20548. See [[dd-wrt-wiki:Index:FAQ#Where_do_I_download_firmware.3F|Where do I download firmware?]] for links.
##AP (Asia Pasific) - Download the NA version of the firmware, then use a Hex Editor to modify the signature at the end of the file.  Change A101-AR7242-RT-100324-01 to A101-AR7242-RT-100324-02
##WW (Any place else in the world) - Download the NA version of the firmware, then use a Hex Editor to modify the signature at the end of the file.  Change A101-AR7242-RT-100324-01 to A101-AR7242-RT-100324-03  
#Connect to the DIR-632 using an Ethernet cable. 
# Open http://192.168.0.1/ in your web browser (Firefox recommended), which should open the DIR632's administrative page from the standard D-link firmware.
## The D-link's default login details are user &quot;admin&quot;, password is blank.
## Tools -&gt; Firmware 
## Click &quot;browse&quot; button -&gt; select the &quot;factory-to-ddwrt_NA.bin&quot; file -&gt; click &quot;Upload&quot; button.
## Wait 2 or 3 minutes for the DIR-632 to flash and do the update. You will see a status page that shows you the progress as it happens. After the flash &amp; update is done, the router will reboot to dd-wrt, and the IP address will have changed to 192.168.1.1. There is no need to reset. 
# Open http://192.168.1.1/ in web browser. This should open DD-WRT's web interface. Configure DD-WRT as desired.
# You're finished! No need to 30/30/30 hard reset, but you can reboot your router after several minutes. (I don't know if it has to build anything in NVRAM, but better safe than sorry.)

===How to upgrade with new DD-WRT firmware===
# Download the &quot;dir632a-firmware&quot; from one of the links from [[Index:FAQ#Where_do_I_download_firmware.3F|Where do I download firmware?]], then pick a recent directory, then use the &quot;dlink-dir632a&quot; directory.
# Open the DD-WRT's web interface in your web browser. It's http://192.168.1.1/ by default.
# Administration tab -&gt; &quot;Firmware Upgrade&quot; button
# Click &quot;browse&quot; button -&gt; select the &quot;dir632a-firmware.bin&quot; file -&gt; click &quot;Upgrade&quot; button.  It will take about 2 minutes to upload and write the flash. Your browser will reload and let you know when it is done.
#It is probably a good idea to reboot after updating. That's it.

===How to reset the Router to initial DD-WRT configuration===
If you forget the username or password, or if the configuration becomes really messed up, you can always clear all the non-volitile parameters by doing a 'factory reset'. To do this, with the router already fully booted, press and hold the reset button for 5~6 seconds and release. The router will boot back up and answer to 192.168.1.1 just as if it had just been flashed with DD-WRT.

===How to restore to factory firmware===
This has been tested by GottaBKD
#Download the original firmware from  http://www.dlink.com/ca/en/home-solutions/connect/routers/-/media/Consumer_Products/DIR/DIR%20632/Firmware/DIR632A1_FW103NA.bin
#Unplug everything from the router including power and any LAN/WAN cables
#Hold down reset button with a pin or bent paperclip for 10 seconds
#While still holding reset button down, plug router back in and hold down the reset button until the status light continually flashes orange
#Configure a Windows 7 computer with IP address in the 192.168.0.2, subnet 255.255.255.0, Gateway 192.168.0.1, DNS 192.168.0.1
#Plug ethernet cable into computer and a LAN port on the router, do not use WAN
#Open FIREFOX, I could only get this to work in FIREFOX, download it if you don't have it. CHROME and IE would not work, they just hang when it looks like they are working! I spent ages trying to get it to work in IE, then downloaded firefox and it worked first try.
#Type 192.168.0.1 into firefox, this should bring up the emergency recovery page
#Click browse and select your firmware file
#Click send, and let it do it's magic, this may take a minute or 2, be patient, if it works your status light will turn green, you are supposed to get a page that says upload succeeded, I waited 5 minutes and it didn't happen. It still worked.
#Reset router by holding down reset button for 10 seconds, status light will go orange again but don't worry it is just rebooting.
#You should be good to go, open a new browser window and type 192.168.0.1 and you should get the Dlink login page. If this doesn't work, try again from step 1

==USB Info==
What follows are the steps needs to use storage devices connected to the routers USB port.  
#Connect the USB device to the Router.
#Restart the router.
#Open the DD-WRT's web interface in your web browser. It's http://192.168.1.1/ by default. 
#Services -&gt; USB

==Notes==
===Pros of this hardware===
*Runs standard version of DD-WRT
*Eight (8) wired ports, at 10/100 speed.
*New Harware.  802.11n WiFi 
*Easy to install DD-WRT
*One USB Port
*Great range, signal strength and stability

===Cons of this hardware===
*The biggest knock about this router is it's frequent WIFI drops and lockups when using the stock firmware.  Installing DD-WRT corrects this isssue.
*No gigabit / 1000 speed LAN support.
*No Wireless AC / IEEE 802.11ac.

===Common Problems===
*Wireless Security WPA2 does not work with i Touches.  Use WPA instead with AES or TKIP+AES encryption.
*When mounting USB devices, an odd message is produced indicating '''Status: Not mounted'''.  This can be ignored. Fixed in beta versions (since at least March 2015).
*Can only load on the NA (North American) versions of the router.  You need to Hex Edit the NA firmware to load elsewhere per the instructions.
*The undocumented button on the right side, near the front is a WDS or Wireless Distribution System button.  It's not used.
*The WiFi Led doesn't light up. Not really a problem. Fixed in beta versions (since at least March 2015).
