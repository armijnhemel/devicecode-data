The WRT600N and the WRT350N are very special in many aspects, they are made by Gemtek instead of Cybertan and they don't follow Linksys common standards and conventions. Both uses 539x switches and the WRT600N cfe doesn't have the vlan setup routine which all other cfe ( the 350N included) has.

&lt;pre&gt;(the vlan config routine in 600N: 

unsigned char bcm_robo_config_vlan (void) 
{ 
return (0); 
} 

that's all  )&lt;/pre&gt;


They are both known for &quot;leaking&quot; from WAN to LAN during boot because with no config the switch defaults to all ports bridged. The WRT350N has for this reason a nvram variable, read by the cfe, to disable the switch during boot but the 600N doesn't have that variable.

So how come the vlanports nvram variables gets overwritten in the 600N? First thing to know is that a cfe never writes those variables, only reads them in order to configure the switch, and in the case of WRT600N not even reads them. Therefore there must be a program module between the dd-wrt vlan gui which configures the switch and also writes the nvram variables so you get the same vlan config after a reboot. Changing the variables manually via Telnet and then issuing a reboot will cause that program to update the variables before it shuts down. You can change them via Telnet as much as you want but they will always be updated to reflect the gui settings.

do an lsmod and look for something like robocfg or switchcfg, that will be the module configuring the vlans via the gui.

working with lom today.. this is the latest:

[3:43 PM] barryware:

&lt;&lt;&lt; Breaking news....

The facory partition does nothing.. It gets the macs from the radios..

The macs match the origional sticker.. Not the cfe or factory part from the old 600.

Sticker = 00:1d:7E:0d:13:75.... 2.4 ghs radio is the sticker mac&lt;br /&gt;
wan = 00:1d:7e:0D:13:77&lt;br /&gt;
Lan = 00:~:13:76&lt;br /&gt;
5ghz = 00:1D:7E:0d:22:b9 which matched the lable on the radio card!&lt;br /&gt;

This is with stock firmware.. have not flashed anything..

There you have it!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

===Known Bugs===
====Initial Flash May Not Work / TFTP problems====
Some users may experience &quot;Failed to Upgrade Firmware&quot; messages when upgrading via Linksys web interface, even when using special 600N-specific builds. Also, TFTP may not work after the router has booted (Linksys fw only). The solution to both is to initiate TFTP within 3-5 seconds of power-on.
