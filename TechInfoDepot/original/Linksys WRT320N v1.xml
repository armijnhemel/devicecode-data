==Notes==
Hello!

Linksys WRT320N is now supported - please use only special _wrt320n.bin builds (based on kernel 2.6).

Hardware:
CPU: BCM4717A 354MHz
flash: 8MB serial
ram: 32MB
radio: A + G
Antenna gain: 1st and 2nd main 1.5 dbi, 3rd antenna: 2.2 dBi
Gigabit ethernet

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''WARNING: this is highly experimental and can brick your router.'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

I'm afraid I have really bad news for all wrt320n users - the only way to unbrick it is by using a serial console, because cfe (common firmware environment) has the wrong command to flash from tftp inside; also, the reset button is not enabled in the cfe (please - dump your anger at Linksys not at the messenger!).

If you have serial console access:

To erase nvram inside cfe, stop it and type:

'''erase nvram'''

'''reboot'''

To flash a new image, you need to stop cfe and issue the following manual command:

'''flash -ctheader : flash1.trx'''

then start tftp transfer.

Right...here is &quot;erase nvram&quot; procedure. You need to open the router. Next to cpu you will see some gpio dots labeled like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
   GPIO11 o  &lt;-copper dot here
     GPIO12
  GPIO15GPIO9
     GPIO6
         o    &lt;- copper dots
       oo
        o    &lt;--- this is gpio6 - short to ground
&lt;/pre&gt;

(a picture of the board is available [http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/files/229_527.jpg here])

And you see 4 copper dots at corner of cpu.
Cfe listens on gpio6 (like most other Linksys routers).

Disconnect the power from the router.
Now get some thin wire or a needle; you need to ground GPIO6 (e.g to radio shield).
Whilst keeping GPIO6 grounded, plug in the power (let somebody help you if needed), keep grounded for 6-8 seconds, then release.
This should erase nvram.



If you are still willing to proceed:

Upgrading the firmware from stock Linksys to dd-wrt is straightforward - use the web GUI to upload new firmware. It is recommended a mini build is used first, then upgrade to any desired build for the router. Don't forget to restore to defaults between flashing the mini build and subsequent builds.

Old wrt320n thread for reference is here [http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=49362 Dual Band (WRT320N) Now Supported]



'''WARNING''': Seems that Linksys wired the reset button to wrong gpio, so''' 30-30-30 reset doesn't work on this router''' (reset button works when dd-wrt runs). Also boot_wait is turned off by default (once you load dd-wrt, it is set to on).

Feedback welcome.

Having spent four days looking at the lengthy topics (71 pages and counting on just one thread!) in the [http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=1 Broadcom SoC based Hardware] forum, FLAGEL collated a lot of useful information and bbb-forever posted a damn good guide to flashing an out-of-the-box router:

====FLAGEL's post====
[http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=396972&amp;highlight=WRT320N#396972 Posted by FLAGEL 17-Jan-2010, last updated 05-Feb-2010]

===Known issues with the WRT320N===
=====Complicated to debrick=====
As the Common Firmware Environment[1.1] has a typo in the command that flashes from TFTP[1.2] a bricked unit must be unbricked with the help of serial console-access[1.3]. To connect to the serial interface of the device, which is located at the bottom and inside the WAN port[1.4], one must use an USB/RS232 to LVTTL (TTL 3,3V)[1.5] adapter as otherwise you can cause damage on your device[1.6].

Also, as the reset button is not enabled in CFE[1.3], to erase NVRAM from within CFE one must issue the command &quot;erase nvram&quot; followed by &quot;reboot&quot;[1.3]. To flash a new image within CFE one must issue the command &quot;flash -ctheader : flash1.trx&quot; and then proceed with the commonly known procedure of TFTP-flashing[1.3]. The issues with the faulty CFE can dealt with once TJATG for this device is in working order[1.7].

If one does not have serial console-access it is possible to erase NVRAM by grounding GPIO6 for 6-8 seconds[1.3]. As seen in a picture of the PCB[1.8] GPIO6 is on top of &quot;19&quot; and right of &quot;20&quot;. More details about grouping GPIO6 can be found in the forum[1.9]

''Update'': 
A work-around[1.10] involving the WPS-button is said to be available as of 2009-12-19 or by build 13493[1.10].

=====30-30-30 reset does not work=====
Linksys wired the reset button to the wrong GPIO, hence a 30-30-30 reset will not work[2.1].

=====UPnP is broken=====
This issue is believed to be a general issue with DD-WRT and the Linux 2.6 kernel[3.1][3.2] (which so far is only used by a few devices, one of them being WRT320N). Many of the UPnP-related issues seem to come from the UPnP-daemon crashing[3.3][3.4]. Some cases report that a viable workaround is changing the UPnP daemon to miniupnpd[3.5].

''Update'': 
Issue is said to be fixed as of 2009-12-28 by build 13527[3.7].

=====CPU use averages to 100%=====
The web-interface tends to show an average CPU use of &gt;=100%[4.1] but when checking top via SSH there doesn't seem to be any process responsible for such use of resources[4.2][4.3], still many users report the device being slow[4.4]. Some users have found the UPnP daemon to crash within a few minutes and that being the source of high CPU utilization[4.5], turning off UPnP seems to help these cases[4.6][4.7].

''Update'': 
Issue is said to be fixed as of 2009-12-28 by build 13527[4.8].

=====No support for VLAN-tagging (IEEE 801.2Q) or Jumbo Frames=====
The switch chip, BCM53115, which can also be found in the Linksys WRT610N, does on hardware-level support both VLAN-tagging (IEEE 801.2Q) and Jumbo Frames[5.1]. However, since the chip is currently lacking a kernel driver the factory configuration cannot be changed. Note that the option &quot;Assign WAN Port to Switch&quot; actually works at the kernel IP level by adding the Internet &quot;vlan2&quot; device to the main bridge[5.2].

=====The LAN-ports are labeled backwards=====
This means that port labeled as 4 on the device is port 1 when it comes to VLAN-configuration, 3 is 2, 2 is 3 and 1 is 4[6.1]. The WAN-port which is labeled 0[6.1].

=====IPv6-related problems=====
There is very little consistent information available on this issue but it seems to be related to radvd[7.1]. This is some of the feedback gotten from users: 
[7.2]&quot;Thanks for the build, The ipv6 using the HE tunnel broker doesn't seem to be working.&quot; 
[7.3]&quot;Thank Eko, the ipv6 seems to be coming up fine now with the 13000 build. I don't see any errors in the log file except that radvd is looking for radvd.conf file in the wrong place. I fixed it by addig radvd -C /tmp/radvd.conf in the startup script. After that cliets get the ipv6 address right, but can't connect to any ipv6 address. Tracert or ping yield 1 Destination net unreachable. I am using HE tunnel broker and I am using the same scripts I used on the 11296M NEWD Eko build on my old WRT54GS ver1 router (which was working for months without any issues)&quot; 
[7.4] &quot;After some research, it seems creating the ipv6 over ipv4 tunnel is failing.&quot; 
[7.5]: &quot;I'm currently running 13000M and I have problems with the ipv6. When I try to create a tunnel interface I get an ioctl: no such device.&quot; 
[7.6]: &quot;Among other things ipv6 is the main reason I use dd-wrt, still no support with the 12982 build, it would be nice if it is supported. daemon.info radvd[792]: version 1.2 started daemon.err radvd[792]: can't create socket(AF_INET6): Address family not supported by protocol&quot;

=====Enabling the OpenVPN client bricks the device=====
The generation of OpenVPN certificates bricks the device due to NVRAM overflowing[8.1][8.2]. The NVRAM is 64KiB big (0x007f0000-0x00800000)[8.2][8.3], but is unfortunately limited to 32KiB as the CFE must be able to read from it[8.4].

'''Issue relevant''' as of: 
2010-02-03

''Update'':

It could be that the ones who have bricked their device have had a lot of other things configured as well, hence NVRAM already having been close to full. One can from a shell with the help of &quot;nvram show | grep size&quot; see how much free NVRAM is available[8.5]. When it comes to server side configuration, using a KEY_SIZE of 1024 will need about 5200 bytes while a KEY_SIZE of 2048 will need about 6000 bytes of NVRAM[8.5]. No mention of client side configuration requirements.

=====Some trouble-shooting tips:=====
''If your router is NOT getting its WAN and DNS'' numbers properly from the cable Internet modem, then...

- Un-plug the cable Internet modem and router, and disable your computer's LAN or Wireless adapter.

- Re-plug the cable Internet modem, wait 1 full minute, then re-plug the DD-WRT router and wait 1 full minute.

- Then enable your computer's LAN or Wireless adapter.

- This should force the DHCP protocol to get the WAN, DNS, and local IPs from your ISP provider and give them to the modem, router, and computer LAN adapter correctly.

- Then login to the DD-WRT Mini build, and go to the Status &gt; WAN page to check the IPs numbers are displayed.


''If you lose Internet access'', but used to have it with the old router, then this may a possible remedy:

- Some Cable Internet providers, like Comcast, do NOT like an unknown (or foreign) MAC address device on its network, and it may (or may not) cut off Internet access within 5-30 minutes. 
- If that happens, then you will have to Clone the MAC Address to be the identical MAC address as either:

(a) the local computer's MAC address or 
(b) the previous router's WAN MAC address (yes, you might have to login to your old router to find it's WAN MAC address or look on the bottom of the router).

- Think of your previous PC or router's MAC address as the &quot;MAC password&quot; to use the Cable Internet system (e.g. Comcast). 
- Seriously, write the nasty hexadecimal MAC address down and keep it safe for any future changes to your router.

- You may NOT have realized it, but Comcast does try to get and lock down the MAC address of the first router device at the time the ISP service is first installed and set-up.

- If you want to deal with your ISP, you may have to call them to see if they can reset your MAC address to get the new MAC on your new router (instead of using the old router's MAC address). 
- Sometimes, it's just easier and faster to Clone the MAC Address than to deal with the ISP customer rep (who may NOT understand what you're asking about), so you decide.
