===DD-WRT Notes===
Comment [[dd-wrt-wiki:User:Bualdoot|Bualdoot]] on 12-Dec-2008: The comments below are from before I added the install instructions above. The comment below was referring to a comment that i removed, because it talked about not being sure if the WRT54Gv2 had more than 2MB memory, which of course we know it does. As for the instructions it gave that he refers to, they were not very clear, so, I made my own set of instructions based off the v1-v1.1 instructions.

all set [Comment from jas3 on 16-Mar-2008: The above worked for me. I then updated from standard to dd-wrt.v23_vpn_generic.bin which succeeded as well] 
May08, When upgrading to v24, please do a full firmware reset (hold reset button for 30 seconds on power up). I did not do this when upgrading to v24 and was getting all sorts of strange behaviors from my router. After resetting and then reconfiguring the router, all was well.

Comment [[dd-wrt-wiki:User:MoT|MoT]] 11:01, 2 Jul 2007 (CEST) : I have been able to flash the VPN version on my V2.0, after flashing from the original Linksys firmware to the mini version first. I followed the V4 tutorial.&lt;br&gt;
After flashing to the mini version, I couldn't flash to the VPN version at first, as I was immediately redirected to a blank page when trying to flash. This seemed to be a problem with IE7, with Firefox, it went fine.

Comment [[dd-wrt-wiki:User:I Use Dial|I Use Dial]] 13:54, 21 Jul 2007 (PDT) I installed mini to my v2.2 through Linksys GUI and had forgotten to reset factory defaults before uploading. I had same problem with blank screen loading but Firefox didn't help. Unplugged it, did a hard reset, unplugged it again, and everything was fine. Then uploaded latest stable version without issue.

Comment [[dd-wrt-wiki:User:Glc|Glc]] 19:00, 31 October 2007 (CET) v2.0 Installed mini generic over Linksys firmware using the web interface, followed by standard generic with web interface. Setting to PPPoE knocked out the WAN port, worked fine in DHCP. Flashed back to mini generic and everything works as advertised.

Comment : Installed mini, then standard generic. No problems except I can't overclock. I try 216 but when applying and restarting all router lights flash together periodically every few seconds. Hard resetting using button takes router back to factory settings and then it works fine. Tried twice on v23 sp2 and once on v24 RC5.

Comment (March 19, 2008) : Just installed dd-wrt on my WRT54G v2 router. I started by installing wrt54gv2 v24 rc6.2 mini through the Linksys web interface and then after I got that installed I used the new dd-wrt mini interface to install wrt54gv2 v24rc6.2 standard generic. Everything is running smoothly and I had no problems in getting dd-wrt installed.

Comment [[dd-wrt-wiki:User:Doppelbock|Doppelbock]] 22:15, 18 April 2008 (PDT) I just installed v23 SP2 full version (generic) on a WRT54G v2.2 that I bought used on eBay and don't seem to have any issues. I had to do a 30-second reset to log into the dd-wrt gui in IE but other than that it's been smooth sailing so far.

Comment [[dd-wrt-wiki:User:Djmoore|Djmoore]] 11:02, 21 June 2008 (CEST) Installed v24-9517_VINT_mini on WRT54G 2.2 using Firefox 3 running on Linux/Ubuntu 8.04 with no problems. 30-30-30 reset before and after.

Comment [[dd-wrt-wiki:User:Erocku|Erocku]] June 2008: I was able to install the v24-9517_VINT_mini on my WRT54G v2.0. After the install I was then able to install the v24-9517_VINT_std with no problems. I was even able to do it from Safari.

Comment [[dd-wrt-wiki:User:jcp rev|jcp_rev]] August 2008: I Installed two days ago dd-wrt.v24_vpn_generic.bin on my WRT54G v2.0. previous version dd-wrt.v23_mini_generic.bin. I did it from Firefox 3. using the standard procedure.

Comment --[[dd-wrt-wiki:User:Dlfretz|Dlfretz]] 18:05, 08/29/2008 (CEST) I was able to install the standard version after flashing the mini version. I just couldn't go straight to the standard version. I installed with Firefox 3.0 on Windows. This is an original Linksys WRT-54G version 2.0

Comment: 28 Sept 08 Uploaded v24sp1-micro generic on a v.2.0 - now I can't upload anything else. Have tried the VINt and the mega-generic and while the upload and reboot appear to be successful, the router still reports the micro version and features are unchanged.

Comment - [[dd-wrt-wiki:User:skaterkfbs|skaterkfbs]] - Followed these instructions for a v2.2 and worked perfectly. I had trouble trying to go directly from LinkSys v4.21.1 firmware to DD-WRT v24 VINT Standard. Had to use the middle DD-WRT v24 VINT Mini.

Comment [[dd-wrt-wiki:User:paillassou|paillassou]] April 2009: My WRT54Gv2.0 [serial#CDF5*****] had an old (but fun too) FIRMWARE [FW = &quot;v4.71.1 Hyperwrt 2.1b1 + Thibor15c&quot;]. I would change for DD-WRT fw. So, after a hard reset 30/30/30 on the thibor15c's fw, i was able to flash successfully, the &quot;mini version&quot; DD-WRT fw through the WEB interface of the thibor15c's fw. I was able to install, 1st, the v24-9517_VINT_mini on my WRT54G v2.0. Reboot OK - DDWRTmini works fine =&gt; hard reset 30/30/30. After that, I was then able to install the v24-9517_VINT_std with no problems. Reboot OK - DDWRTstd works fine =&gt; hard reset 30/30/30. I was even able to do it from IE7. Install = FREEBOXv4 + WRT54Gv2.0 with FW=DD-WRTv24-9517_VINT_std. All is right. Thanks a lot for the tutorial and informations ;o)

Comment [[dd-wrt-wiki:User:Atlasit|atlasit]] July 2009: After installing the mini firmware to a WRT54G v2.0 using IE8, clicked the Continue button and did a hard reset. The screen that comes up after the reset prompts to change the user and password of the router. It would not continue after clicking the button until I viewed the page in 'Compatibility Mode'. Then it took the changes.

Comment --[[dd-wrt-wiki:User:Educmale|Educmale]] 06:07, 11 November 2009 (CET): With Ver2.2, I noticed that both the VINT-std and the STD versions install and work fine, almost ---- the STD version won't allow a virtual wireless LAN to connect using WPA2-pers security, while operating in repeater mode. It acts like there is a bug there, in the STD version, in that virtual areaâ€”Odd, as the STD version -will- connect as a wireless access point, using the same WPA2-pers setup. In contrast, VINT will allow the same set up to let the WPA2-pers function either as an AP or a virtual wireless Lan. [The STD version was the one available 3days ago; perhaps this bug will be fixed, one day?]
