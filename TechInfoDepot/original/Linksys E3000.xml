==Flashing==
{{Flashnotice}}
===Flashing dd-wrt===
{{DDWRTNotice|microno}}
{{DDWRTNotice|k26req}}
Supported by dd-wrt as of = K26 build 14567

The work is definitely in progress as of June 2010 (read thread first):   
http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=73601&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0

'''As of July 2010 you can only use the trailed builds with the e3000 name in it for initial flashing and nothing else, using other bin's without the e3000 name in it for initial flashing may result in a bricked unit! After you have dd-wrt installed to your unit, you can then use the e2k-e3k.bin's for upgrading to newer builds. This is a common error which is leading to many bricks in which serial is the only method for recovery, so read carefully!'''

* Use only e3000 specific firmware (with '''e3000''') in the name, minimum 14584 Eko build. For example dd-wrt.v24-14584_NEWD-2_K2.6_big-e3000.bin
* Flash straight to the big build using Cisco-Linksys web interface.
* After successful upgrade message comes up, give it extra 2-3 minutes to complete flashing.
* You may need to clear your browser cache after flashing to see dd-wrt's web interface
* Some people have been having heat issues. Razing the router off the ground helped.
* It has been reported that you can revert to the original firmware by simple upgrading through the GUI, source http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=74703

# Disconnect all cables and wireless clients.
# Do a 30/30/30 reset on router.
# Connect 1 Lan cable to pc doing the flash.
# Log into Web Interface and flash the firmware ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/V24-K26/svn14853/dd-wrt.v24-14853_NEWD-2_K2.6_big-e3000.bin
# Wait 5 minutes until WAN light turns on.
# Power cycle by unplugging E3000 for 30 secs.
# Plug E3000 back in and wait about 5 minutes until it finishes booting.
# Do a 30/30/30 reset on router.
# Wait 3 minutes and log into web interface.

DD-WRT E3000 Build information

The latest builds for this unit can be currently found in the FTP. Support was added in 14826 and on.

ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/V24-K26/

Brainslayer added E3000 Support from 14929 and on and builds are to be found in the broadcom_K26 folder of his build branch.

ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/

Also it has been asked about the builds with e2k-e3k name in them, these builds are for if you already have those units flashed with dd-wrt, you can simply use one of those builds to upgrade, but the initial flash should always be done with the trailed build (build with the unit only name in it) linked above.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Flashing OpenWrt===
Please insert instructions here

===Flashing Tomato===
Supported by TomatoUSB as of = Build 54/(special E3000 Ext or VPN build required)

Please insert instructions here

==Upgrading==
If dd-wrt is already on the router any build with nv60k in the name can be used.
{{Upgrade dd-wrt}}

==Reverting==
===Reverting dd-wrt===
To revert back to stock firmware from dd-wrt do the following.

# Go to Linksys support site and download the latest stock E2000 firmware image.
# From within the dd-wrt webgui go to Administration &gt; Factory Defaults, and reset to factory defaults.
# Once you router has reset to factory defaults, set a static ip on your machine to 192.168.1.6 and access the webgui @ http://192.168.1.1
# It should prompt you to set a user/password, do so, then from the webgui, go to Administration &gt; Firmware Upgrade
# Select to reset to defaults on the drop down menu and then browse to the stock firmware image for the E2000, select the file and flash.
# Wait 5 mins from flashing, then do a 30-30-30 reset and login again @ http://192.168.1.1 and begin your config on stock firmware.

* Should you want to use DHCP you will need to then unset your static ip on your machine.

==JTAG-Serial Info==
===Serial===
====Serial Pinouts====
There are 5 solder pads near the rim on the backside of the PCB, see image from WRT610n:
[[File:Wrt610n pcb back.jpg]]

====Serial Recovery====
=====Unbrick hard bricked (no ping) Linksys E3000 via serial connection.=====
I accidentally flashed the wrong dd-wrt firmware on my Linksys E3000.&lt;br /&gt;This prevented me from recovering with any firmware. I was unable to reset the router, ping the default address, or communicate with it in any way.&lt;br /&gt;
To recover I had to initiate a serial connection.

This router, along with others has serial contacts inside, on the bottom of the WAN port.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to make a cable out of a 40 PIN IDE cable that would touch these contacts, but got tired of fiddling with it. Instead I opted to solder directly to the board.

The first step in this process was to open the router. This requires a TORX T-10 Security screwdriver bit. I was able to purchase this for about $8 at my local lowes. It’s the TORX bit with a hole in the center.

Next, I had to pull the plastic chassis off, which was quite difficult. I found it easiest to seperate the pieces from the front.

After the casing was removed, I had to unclip the three antenna wires, and flip the board around. The serial contacts are located on the underside.

[http://www.lukemacneil.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/img1.jpg]

After locating the contacts for the serial port, I had to identify which of them needed to be used.&lt;br /&gt;My Serial-&gt;USB adapter was a CA-42 Nokia cable that I bought off ebay. There were 3 wires in the cable. Blue (GND), Green (RXD), and White (TXD).

These three wires had to be attached to contacts 5 (GND), 3 (TXD), and 2 (RXD).&lt;br /&gt;Note it’s important that the RXD wire must be attached to the TXD contact, and TXD on the wire to the RXD contact.

[http://www.lukemacneil.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/img2.jpg]

Once these wires have been soldered to the appropriate contacts, the serial connection should work.&lt;br /&gt;Connect to it from a terminal using 115200 baud, 8N1 with No Flow Control (hardware or software) and ANSI emulation. I use linux, so I used minicom as a terminal, but you could also use hyperterminal in windows.

Now, plug in the USB end of the cable to your computer, and plug in, and power on the router.&lt;br /&gt;You should see activity in the terminal as the router powers up.

[http://www.lukemacneil.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/img3.jpg]

Once you’ve verified that there’s activity, turn off the router and turn it back on. Quickly begin hitting CTRL-C in the terminal until you reach the CFE&gt; prompt.

Once you’ve reached the CFE&gt; prompt the router should be up with networking. At this point you should be plug an ethernet cable into the router and ping 192.168.1.1

[http://www.lukemacneil.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/img4.jpg]

First, clear the nvram by typing:
{|
| class=&quot;number&quot;|1
| class=&quot;content&quot;|CFE&gt; nvram erase
|}
Once that has completed, you can begin to send the ORIGINAL linksys firmware to the device.

Using another terminal (or command prompt) prepare the TFTP command to put the firmware on the device.&lt;br /&gt;In linux, I connected to tftp 192.168.1.1, then set the mode to binary, set the timeout to 90 seconds, and entered:
{|
| class=&quot;number&quot;|1
| class=&quot;content&quot;|CFE&gt; put &lt;filename&gt;
|}
.&lt;br /&gt;Don’t execute the put yet, just get it ready.

Back at the CFE&gt; prompt, type:
{|
| class=&quot;number&quot;|1
| class=&quot;content&quot;|CFE&gt; flash -ctheader : flash1.trx
|}
As soon as you execute the flash command, execute the tftp command. This will upload the firmware.

After the firmware is copied to the router, in the CFE prompt, type:
{|
| class=&quot;number&quot;|1
| class=&quot;content&quot;|CFE&gt; go
|}
The router will reboot and load it’s new firmware.
