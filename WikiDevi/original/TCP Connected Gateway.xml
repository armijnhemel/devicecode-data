SOME TIPS FOR GETTING YOUR TCP / Greenwave Systems / Greenwave 
:Reality LIGHTBULBS AND GATEWAY TO FIND EACH OTHER

'''Troubleshooting:'''

*'''Light Bulb Not Responding During Installation:'''
When you add a new light bulb to the network (or if you add a previously existing light bulb that 
:you removed from the network), the light bulb should brighten and dim during the installation 
:process to indicate that it is searching for a network.

If for any reason the light bulb does not brighten and dim (if it remains full bright), then
:turn power to the light fixture off and on four times consecutively to reset the light bulb. 
The light bulb should then start to brighten and dim once it is reset, which is usually within 
:10 seconds after the fourth off/on cycle.

*'''Light Bulb Accidentally Removed from Network:'''
It is possible for a network light bulb to be accidentally removed from the network. For example, 
:if someone turns power off and on four times consecutively to the light fixture, the attached 
:light bulb will reset and remove itself from the network. If this happens, follow the procedure 
:in the Light Bulb Tasks chapter to add a new light bulb to the network.

*'''Resetting Your Light Bulbs:'''
If you are unable to fix issues that arise with your lighting system, you can reset your light 
:bulbs as a last resort. To do so, follow the procedure in the Light Bulb Tasks chapter to remove 
:light bulbs from the network, followed by the procedure to add a new light bulb to the network.
