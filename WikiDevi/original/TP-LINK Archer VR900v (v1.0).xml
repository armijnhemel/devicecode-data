''All-In-One Box Telefonie WLAN-AC Modem Router''

*[https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tp-link_archer_vr900v_1.0 ''TP-LINK Archer VR900v'' on '''OpenWrt''' wiki]
&lt;small&gt;'''Note''': This model is ''not'' the VR900, but the VR900'''v'''. 
:Both differ quite substancially in both hardware and pricing. 
:Be careful not to mix up &quot;VR900'''v''' (v1.0)&quot; and &quot;VR900 ('''v'''1.0)&quot;!&lt;/small&gt;

===Specifications===
:The device runs on 2 entirely different SoCs:
&lt;small&gt;'''CPU:'''
* [[Broadcom]] BCM4709 (2x 1GHz ARM Cortex-A9) with RAM 128MB and flash 16MB.
* [[Broadcom]] BCM63168 (2x 400MHz MIPS) with RAM 64MB and flash 8MB.

'''Flash:'''
:''Spansion'' S25FL128SAGMFI00 16MB (FL128SAIF00, 439QQ0009 A, SPANSION)
:''Winbond'' W25Q64FVSSIG 8MB (Winbind, 25Q64FVSIG, 1532)
:''Winbond'' W25Q80BVSSIG 1MB (Winbond, 25Q80BVSIG, 1444) (DECT)

'''RAM:'''
:''SK hynix'' H5TQ1G63EFR-PBC 128MB (H5TQ1G63EFR, PBC 444V, NWLC2479XH3)
:''Zentel'' A3R12E40CBF-8E 64MB (A3R12E40CBF, -8E, 527ZENV6, 57025694G-F)

*For wired ethernet connectivity, the integrated NICs of the BCM4709 are used.
:That SoC supposedly also features some hardware offloading capabilities 
:as well as hardware accelerated routing.

*Wi-fi is provided by 2 BCM4360 with an unknown number of antennas. 
:The device has 3 external RP-SMA connectors for wifi, yet the exact 
:wiring/mapping is unknown.

&lt;pre&gt;(root@localhost.localdomain) (gcc version 4.6.2 (Buildroot 2011.11)) 
#1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Aug 24 10:08:45 HKT 2015;unknown OS on BCM4709&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;

===Serial===
The device has at least 2, possibly 3 serial interfaces 
:on the unpopulated 4 pin headers J4, J7 and J8.
*J4 (unpopulated 3.3V TTL, RX-TX-GND-VCC, 115200,8,N,1)
*J7 (unpopulated, 3.3V TTL, ?-?-GND-VCC)
*J8 (unpopulated, 3.3V TTL, RX-TX-GND-VCC, 115200,8,N,1)
:All operate at 3.3V TTL, J4 and J8 run at 115200,8,N,1, 
:whilst the exact function of J7 is yet unknown.
:The pinout of all headers is RX-TX-GND-VCC, whilst the exact 
:function of the RX and TX pins on J7 is yet to be found.&lt;small&gt;
:At least on my board, it was virtually impossible to solder the GND pins 
:on all 3 headers (the other pins could be soldered without any problem).
:You probably need to brass-brush them prior to soldering (do not brush 
:them after soldering or you will spread fine-ground solder over the PCB, 
:causing possible shortages!).

===VoIP / DECT===
*2 separate VoIP ports are offered through which POTS telephones can be used for VoIP 
:telephony. Both ports feature a German TAE socket ''and'' a classical RJ11 socket.
:I have not tested if you can connect 2 phones simultanously to the same VoIP port.
*DECT is provided by a DSP DCX81 with a small separated antenna PCB which is integrated 
:into the router's plastic case and is not visible or accessible from the outside.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;small&gt;The device features 4 buttons (reset pinhole, DECT, WiFi, WPS) and 8 LEDs. 
The case has 2 cross-head screws under its rubber feet and countless sturdy latches on 
the inside which make it almost impossible to pry the casing open without damaging it. 
The top cover of the casing consists of an outer layer of transparent plastic and an 
inner layer of white plastic, which are glued together. 
To open the case, you start by prying off the transparent layer - it won't entirely come 
off the inner white layer, but will eventually pull that one with it off the bottom shell. 
You need to use a considerable amount of force, but you do ''not'' need any special tools 
(beside the screwdriver for the aforementioned screws). 
The silverish frame around the casing is ''not'' made of metal but of plastic, it can only 
be removed by removing 4 screws from the inner side of the bottom shell. 
The PCB carries a large heatsink with 3 reusable (but extremely soft and vulnerable) 
thermal pads can be removed once the 3 screws holding it in place are removed. 
The 2 wifi chips controllers and the BCM4709 SoC with the RAM for both SoCs hide under 2 RF 
shieldings which can be carefully removed from their frames using fine tweezers or dental tools. 
Both shieldings also carry delicate (but reusable) thermal pads under them. &lt;/small&gt; --&gt;
