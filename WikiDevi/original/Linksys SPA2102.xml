&lt;small&gt;
*The [[Linksys SPA2102]] is gateway router/analog telephony adapter (commonly referred to
:as ATA) with two FXS ports, which allows for the connection of two “normal” telephones to 
:a VoIP provider using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) protocol. The product is based
:on the SPA-2100, made by '''Sipura''' Technology, which was acquired by [[Cisco]] in 2005.
*The ethernet chip is likely a custom version made for '''Sipura'''. The board picture 
:(see bellow) shows a ''Micrel SPN801024'' with lot number GFK7344.1M01. 
*Another picture [http://www.usbjtag.com/vbforum/attachment.php?s=8f37fccd51028ae31d7b3c66a615744f&amp;attachmentid=382&amp;d=1281192427 (found here)] shows a Micrel '''SPNZ801030''' whit lot number GFS7976.1. 
:Both lot numbers are close to GFK7343.1MEG and GFS7975.1MED found in the '''Micrel'''
:MTBF report (see links &amp; screenshot), which identify a '''KS8842''' chip.

:-NA or -EU means that the device is not associated with a particular VoIP provider (unlocked).
Devices without -NA or -EU usually have another -XX designation and are locked to a specific VoIP Provider.
:If you are looking to purchase used equipment, make sure it is a -NA or -EU model.
Other models are not truely &quot;unlocked&quot; and will not be supported by Linksys or other prodivers.

===[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sipura_Technology On '''Wikipedia''']===
*'''SPA2000''': Basic phone adapter that allows two plain old telephone service (POTS) phones or fax machines
:to be connected to an Ethernet network in order to make and receive telephone calls or faxes.
*'''SPA2100''': Similar to the SPA2000 with the addition of an Ethernet router. Functions of the built-in router include QoS.
*'''SPA3000''': The SPA3000 has one phone adapter port (FXS), one FXO port and can be used for POTS backup for strictly VoIP systems.
*'''SPA3102''': Similar to the SPA3000, it includes a single LAN output that can be used to connect to a computer.
:This is handy if the user only has an ISP modem and no router. The SPA3102 connects to the LAN socket on the ISP modem.
:The computer, which is traditionally connected to the modem, now connects directly to the LAN connection on the SPA3102.
:The SPA3102, effectively, is an ATA and single output router in one box.
*'''SPA9000''': An IP PBX system that allows an auto-attendant to be configured, hunt groups, multiple IP phone extensions, and 
:POTS connectors. The SPA9000 also has basic router functions, port forwarding, quality of service, and DTMF functionality.
*'''SPA901''': A basic IP phone with only one line.
*'''SPA921''': A single-line phone with LCD screen.
*'''SPA922''': A single-line phone with LCD screen, but adds a single port built in switch.
*'''SPA941''': The flagship of the SPA phones, it incorporates a 4-line IP phone and an LCD.
*'''SPA942''': Similar to the 941 aside from the additions of power over Ethernet ability, back-lit screen, and a single port built-in switch.
*'''SPA962''': Similar in appearance and functionality to the 941/942, it features a six line, 2-inch color screen
