# Do a factory reset in the Asus GUI. Let the router reboot. Disconnect all cables (WAN, USB, etc.) and plug the Ethernet cable from your PC into the LAN1 port on the router.
# Using Internet Explorer (IMPORTANT), Flash the downloaded firmware file through the router's GUI at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://192.168.1.1/&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This process takes about 60 seconds. Asus factory default username/password is admin/admin.
## ALTERNATE - I was unable to get the initial firmware flashed on a stock router containing the latest RN-16 firmware. Alternatively you can use the ASUS Firmware Restoration Utility (included on router CD or downloadable from [http://www.thesystemownsyou.com/mirror/UT_RT_N16_4090.zip]) to flash the initial firmware. Install the application, load up the initial firmware, then unplug the router, and replug it in with the black RESTORE button depressed. The power light should now be blinking slowly, meaning the router is in restore mode and ready for the new firmware. Upload and wait for router reset. This was the only method that allowed me overwrite stock firmware. Follow remainder of instructions normally. - ApatheticNow -
# After the reboot from flashing, wait for the device to show the password change screen for DD-WRT. Enter '''''root''''' as the user and anything for the password as you will do the user/pass procedure again after the final flash.
# Do a Factory Reset to clear the NVRAM. This is located under Administration -&gt; Factory Defaults in the DD-WRT Web-GUI, or open up a telnet session to your router and type '''''erase nvram''''' followed by the command '''''reboot''''' (This is the preferred method). You will be presented with the password change screen again after this step is complete.
# Download and flash the full featured Firmware [ftp://dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2010/08-12-10-r14929/broadcom_K26/dd-wrt.v24-14929_NEWD-2_K2.6_big.bin dd-wrt.v24-14929_NEWD-2_K2.6_big.bin] under Administration -&gt; Firmware Upgrade.
## NOTE : in the Firmware Upgrade Tab where it says &quot;After flashing, reset to&quot; choose &quot;Reset to Default settings&quot;.
## NOTE : For the final flash (Upgrade), it is wise to walk away for ~5 minutes while the Mega Firmware is flashing. This ensures all NVRAM variables are successfully loaded by the Kernel before the user configures.

# Download the latest ASUS firmware from asus's site.
# Rename the asus file from .trx to .bin
# go into the DD-WRT firmware upgrade page, set it to reset defaults, and select the ASUS firmware you renamed.
# After the flash finishes, and you see the ASUS GUI, do a Factory Reset to clear the NVRAM.
# Try to enjoy ASUS's firmware, and keep missing DD-WRT. (you can just flash back to dd-wrt if you ever want)

==DD-WRT Recovery Mode==
This router does have a recovery mode if ever needed for flashing, and to access it, press the reset button, then plug in power, and tftp the firmware you want to flash. Dont forget to do a Factory Reset in the GUI before and after every flash to make sure you dont have any nvram problems or conflicts.

Special thanks to Eko for making this possible!

:Confirmed working on an Asus RT-N16 using 14929 K2.6 NEWD-2, I had to add the commands..

 insmod switch-core
 insmod switch-robo

and save as startup, after which

 ls /proc/switch

Showed up, also as jumran mentioned, the webgui works thereafter the ins~ commands are saved to startup.

==Notes==
===DD-WRT Notes===
'''Build 15407 and later'''

The devs of dd-wrt have removed the loading of file system drivers from the startup of the firmware. 
:They are now loaded on demand with automount. Well, this presents a problem for those of us with 
:USB HDD that automount doesn't detect. In order to load the file system drivers at startup you need 
:to add the following to save startup in the commands tab.

For K2.6 builds only that have the modules already in place
&lt;pre&gt;
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.24.111/kernel/fs/mbcache.ko
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.24.111/kernel/fs/ext2/ext2.ko
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.24.111/kernel/fs/jbd/jbd.ko
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.24.111/kernel/fs/ext3/ext3.ko
&lt;/pre&gt;
This loads the ext2 and ext3 file system drivers.

'''The mtd flash partitions'''

The factory firmware and the dd-wrt firmware use different partition schemes.

ASUS has 4 partitions:
 0x00000000-0x00040000 : &quot;boot&quot;
 0x00040000-0x01fe0000 : &quot;linux&quot;
 0x001dff88-0x01fe0000 : &quot;rootfs&quot;
 0x01fe0000-0x02000000 : &quot;nvram&quot;
dd-wrt has 5 :
 0x00000000-0x00040000 : &quot;cfe&quot;
 0x00040000-0x01fe0000 : &quot;linux&quot;
 0x00187000-0x00720000 : &quot;rootfs&quot;
 mtd: partition &quot;rootfs&quot; doesn't start on an erase block boundary – force read-only
 0x01fe0000-0x02000000 : &quot;nvram&quot;
 0x00720000-0x01fe0000 : &quot;ddwrt&quot;

likely the &quot;linux&quot; partition is not dd-wrt at all, but a remnant of the ASUS fw, as rootfs 
:overlaps with it. in either case, the asus &quot;boot&quot; is binary identical to dd-wrt &quot;cfe&quot;

what does a functioning OpenWRT partition scheme look like?

'''Default vlans'''

 nvram show | grep vlan.ports
 vlan0ports=1 2 3 4 5*     &lt;-- Eko says it causes no problems
 vlan1ports=4 3 2 1 8*     &lt;-- natted LAN
 vlan2ports=0 8            &lt;-- WAN

For newer 802.11n routers the variable vlan1ports equals to the natted LAN side while, vlan2ports refers 
:to the WAN side. Was told by Eko not to worry about vlan0ports, that it didn't cause any problems.

*[http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=86942 (Solved) RT-N16 Vlan Bridge problem when using PPPOE]

'''Overclocking'''

By factory default the cpu is clocked at 480{{abbr|MHz|megahertz}} and the Ram at 240{{abbr|MHz|megahertz}}. 
:Overclocking at CPU 532{{abbr|MHz|megahertz}} / Ram 266&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|MHz|megahertz}} can be achieved with these commands:

 nvram set clkfreq=532,266
 nvram commit
 reboot

Note: some users have had overheating issues, so adding a fan may be a good idea if you want to try the overclocking.&lt;br&gt;
Note: other instability issues may also arise from overclocking. Overclocking is NOT a good idea.&lt;br&gt;
Note: See also &lt;!-- [[dd-wrt-wiki:Overclocking BCM 47xx CPU's| --&gt; ''Overclocking BCM 47xx CPU's'' for more info.

'''UPnP fix with swap on'''

If using SVN13450 (''Eko Big'') which still has swap enable option, you can 
:manually enable UPnP with these commands in your start-up script:
 nvram set wan0_primary=1
 nvram commit

===Current Known DD-WRT Issues and Bugs===
* UPNP is currently not working for the RT-N16, so for now leave the feature disabled unless you want a full CPU Load. '''Fixed''' with SVN [http://svn.dd-wrt.com:8000/changeset/13527 trac Changeset #13527]

* Access Restriction with MAC-Filter doesn't work on Asus RT-N16. [http://svn.dd-wrt.com:8000/ticket/1319 trac Ticket #1319](as of 12/18/09)

* On this router reset button will only bring you to recovery mode. If you wish to restore defaults, use wps button while plugging power in. [http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=388920#388920 Post By Eko]

==Personal Experiences==
[[User:DarkShadow|Dark_Shadow]] (This information was gathered when support was in its infancy, it's long outdated):

My current USB HDD, dd-wrt's automount doesn't mount. In Tomato USB it automounts fine. 
:I have a HDD comming for another USB HDD enclosure. It's a [[Antec MX-1]], we'll see how that one fairs.

Currently have 2x [[Western Digital My Book Essential 2TB]].

It detected and automounted the drive, but only the first partition. 
:Seems way to complicated to get the other partitions mounted.

Using My compiled (This was ages ago and I no longer have the buildand no longer compile) TomatoUSB build 54 
:seems everything works so far (currentlty using Shibby builds). It also has a superior wireless signal.

Things I've tried thus far: (RT-N16)
:Firmware itself - Works
:Wireless radio - Works
:USB support - Works
:File sharing - Works
:Media Server - Works
:My custom firewall - Works
:Automatic script execution - Works
:Swap - Works
:Custom Theme/Skin for GUI - Works

:''FernSpider'':
With recommended DD-WRT build (14929M) on Asus RT-N16's I experienced the following issues:

* httpd daemon crashes (100% CPU) when https WAN management option is enabled. This problem has also been reported [http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=60382 here] and [http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=461341#461341 here] and a ticket was raised [http://svn.dd-wrt.com:8000/ticket/1287 here]. However, even though the ticket was closed because the bug was deemed to have been &quot;fixed&quot;, no details are given and it is not clear that it has actually been fixed. As the crash may take days to happen it is difficult to diagnose the problem and therefore devise a workaround.
* Access Restrictions do not work with unbridged virtual wireless interfaces. The problem appears to be due to a bug in the &quot;Add Bridge&quot; GUI code which adds a rule to the iptables FORWARD chain before the lan2wan chain reference which ACCEPT's all packets originating from the new bridge. As a consequence the access restrictions which apply to traffic on this bridge are rendered ineffective. This problem can be fixed via a firewall script which searches for firewall rules targeting packets originating from the added bridges and moving them further down the FORWARD chain. 

Features that work well for me:
:Wireless Radio
:Custom Firewall
:Multiple WLAN's
:Separate WLAN's
