'''DO NOT use Firefox for upgrading builds! Use Internet Explorer!'''
# Download the firmware [ftp://dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2010/08-12-10-r14929/broadcom_K26/dd-wrt.v24-14929_NEWD-2_K2.6_mini_RT-N12.trx dd-wrt.v24-14929_NEWD-2_K2.6_mini_RT-N12.trx].
# For simplicity, connect '''only''' the PC to one of the router's LAN ports with a normal [uplink] ethernet cable. No other modem,computers,routers,switches, etc should be connected.
# In order to prevent DHCP from interupting the connection, you will need to manually set the address of your PC's Network LAN card to a '''STATIC IP''' in the same subnet of the router, such as 192.168.1.10 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 . Also make sure all other adapters,such as wireless, which might be seen as &quot;clients&quot; by the router are disabled. Only the main LAN connection [IP: 192.168.1.10] should be able to communicate with the router.
# Unplug the power connector from the back of the router.
# While pushing &amp; holding the '''recessed''' Restore button on the back of the router, plug the power connector back in. The Restore button is NOT the raised red WPS button.
# When the power LED '''slowly''' blinks on and off, release the Restore button. The router is now in &quot;RESCUE MODE&quot;.
# Use the Asus Firmware Restoration Utility [which you should have installed on the PC] to upload the DD-WRT mini-asus.trx file from the location where you saved it.
# '''DO NOT DISTURB THE ROUTER or PC FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES. BE PATIENT!'''
# After the upgrade, the Utility should ask for a router reboot. Give it '''AT LEAST''' a minute to be on the safe side before removing the power. Then unplug the power from the router, wait 10 seconds or so and plug the power back in. You should now be able to access the web interface.
# Return your Net adapter properties for TCP/IP to DHCP &quot;Automatically Obtain IP&quot;
# Type 192.168.1.1 into your browser and set your username as root and pick a password.

'''ALTERNATE INSTALLATION METHOD FOR ASUS TO DD-WRT FW UPDATE'''
:The steps listed above did not work for me, but these steps did.

# Disconnect all ethernet cables from the RT-N12 except 1 going to your NIC.
# Turn off all wireless clients (notebooks, PS3 etc...)
# Ensure DHCP is enabled in the ASUS firmware and retreive IP/DNS automatically is set in your NIC properties.
#(When you open your IE browser it will instruct you to plug back in your WAN ISP cable, if your PC is still seeing the router. If not, you may need to reboot router and/or PC.)
# Do the 30/30/30 peacock method of putting your router in recovery mode.
# Open the router IP of 192.168.1.1. The page will open to a built in browser (HTTP) recovery console.
# Click on the [ftp://dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2010/08-12-10-r14929/broadcom_K26/ link] Reboot to reset/flash the Vram.
# Click the Browse button to browse to your DD-WRT firmware file location.
# Click the Upload button.
# The router will upload the file fairly quickly, and you will be brought to the next screen that says &quot;Allow router time to reboot.&quot; BE PATIENT this takes about 4â€“5 minutes. You will see the LAN1 light turn off and notice the &quot;Network Cable Unplugged&quot; windows popup message in task bar. Wait for the light to turn back on and the PC to reconnect to router.
# Click the &quot;Continue&quot; link shown on the page.
# Clicking &quot;Continue&quot; forces the router to perform another reboot. When it comes back up you will be at the DD-WRT admin login screen.
#If the login screen is white and looks very basic you will need to perform another reboot of the router by removing the power cable. }}
