===Flashing OpenWrt===
[https://openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g#installing_openwrt Linksys WRT54G] On the '''OpenWrt''' Wiki

====Using the Linksys web GUI====
It is possible to install OpenWrt directly with the Linksys web GUI. If you are initially installing OpenWrt use the Linksys web GUI, this is the easiest way.

*Download the openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin firmware image from the brcm-2.4 folder to your PC.
*You can find that image at: http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm-2.4/
*Actually the safest version to use would be '''&lt;s&gt;8.09&lt;/s&gt;'''. Hmmm, it looks like 10.03.1 is safe but you must use the '''brcm-2.4''' variant like in the link above. I am not risking bricking my router for the initial flash, so I am going with '''8.09'''.
*Open http://192.168.1.1/Upgrade.asp in your browser or manually go to http://192.168.1.1 → Administration → Firmware Upgrade
*Upload openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin
*Wait 2 minutes. The router will reboot itself automatically after the upgrade is complete.
*Your router should now be telnettable at 192.168.1.1. The web interface luci is also available at http://192.168.1.1 . Telnet is disabled and ssh is enabled once a password has been set.
*Type these commands out in telnet/ssh. This is to ensure that tftp is available, in case your router gets bricked.

 nvram set boot_wait=on
 nvram set boot_time=10
 nvram set wait_time=10 #important for some models
 nvram commit &amp;&amp; reboot

*'''You're done!''' At this point, you are free to continue using brcm-2.4. However, if you wish to use brcm47xx, proceed below.
*Download the image openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx here: http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm47xx/
*Upload using luci at System &gt; Flash Firmware
*'''OR''', you can simply ssh into the router,

cd /tmp
wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx
sysupgrade /tmp/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx

*Wait for the router to reboot and login! In case you somehow found out that you can't telnet, then ssh should be possible since your previous settings before flashing remained (unless you used sysupgrade -n)

====Using the TFTP method====
Right after flashing at your first login to OpenWrt set the following NVRAM parameters to enable tftpd at bootup:

 nvram set boot_wait=on
 nvram set boot_time=10
 nvram set wait_time=10
 nvram commit &amp;&amp; reboot

'''NOTE:''' Do not touch any other NVRAM parameters. NVRAM is only used as environment for the bootloader. OpenWrt ignores NVRAM parameters.

'''NOTE:''' On WRT54GL (at least), you should probably use 'wait_time' instead of 'boot_time'. bg300: Added.

'''NOTE:''' On WRT54GS v1.1 too you have to use 'wait_time' instead of 'boot_time', anyway if in doubt add both parameters.

Once you have set the NVRAM parameters above it is possible to use a TFTP client to flash OpenWrt. The TFTP method is also '''the recommended way to restore the original Linksys firmware or switch to other third-party firmwares'''.

First download a firmware image file ending in &quot;.bin&quot;, e.g. openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin.

Then follow the [https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/installation/generic.flashing.tftp Generic TFTP flashing instructions].

==Upgrading==
{{Upgrade dd-wrt}}
===Upgrading OpenWrt===
====Using mtd OR sysupgrade====
If you have already installed OpenWrt and like to reflash for e.g. upgrading to a new OpenWrt version. It is important that you put the firmware image into the ramdisk (/tmp) before you start flashing.

cd /tmp/
wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx # The file must be the trx file.
mtd write /tmp/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx linux &amp;&amp; reboot

OR

cd /tmp/
wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx # The file must be the trx file.
sysupgrade /tmp/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx

Feel free to explore the rest of sysupgrade options by typing 'sysupgrade' in the terminal.

====Using LuCI====
#Select Administration in the top right corner
#Choose the System &gt; Flash Firmware tab
#Click Browse and navigate to the firmware (it must be a .trx file) you wish to flash to
#Click 'Upload image'
#Follow the instructions

====Upgrading from Tomato====
The instructions from the [http://www.polarcloud.com/tomatofaq#installing_another_firmware_or Tomato upgrade instructions] are confirmed to work with Backfire (10.03.1-rc4, r24045)

====Rare 32MB====
'''anectine17 wrote:''' The v.2 and v.2.2, on occasion, came with a 32MB RAM chip with only 16MB enabled. The vast majority of these routers came with a basic 16MB RAM chip. To tell whether or not you have the &quot;special&quot; one with the 32MB chip, you have to open the router and read the number on the RAM chip itself. If you have chip #issi is'''42s16800a-7t''', you can enter
 nvram set sdram_init=0x008
 nvram set sdram_ncdl=0x000
 nvram commit
 reboot
and that will enable all 32MB. If you have any other chip, that hack will not work...in fact if you try it, you'll end up with a brick. Good luck.

The '''Hynix''' chip, '''HY5DU281622ET-J''' is the most common one in the v.2 and v.2.2. I've taken apart probably 50 v.2's and a dozen 2.2's and I've seen 2 of the 32MB chips in the v.2.2, and 4 in the v.2. They're out there, but getting harder and harder to come by. Most people hang on to them once they get them.
